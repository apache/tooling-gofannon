"""Cooperative cancellation primitive (ISSUE-007).

A ``CancelToken`` is a tiny flag-with-a-method-name. It's bound to an
asyncio task via a ``ContextVar`` so structurally distant code paths
(LLM service, data-store proxy, gofannon-client) can poll it without a
signature change. asyncio task context inheritance means a chained
agent automatically shares the parent's token — stopping the parent
stops the children.

Enforcement happens at *structural boundaries*: at entry to each
tool invocation we call ``check_should_stop()``, which raises
``AgentStopped`` if the token has been set. In-flight LLM HTTP
requests finish naturally; only the *next* observable action is
interrupted. This is intentionally less aggressive than
``task.cancel()``, which would interrupt mid-await and skip cleanup
handlers.

    Path A executor uses this to also cancel the agent task on its
