"""Run registry — in-process record of agent runs (ISSUE-003).

A ``RunRecord`` holds everything the runs UX needs to display, replay, and
(in ISSUE-007) cancel an in-flight or recently-completed agent run. The
``RunRegistry`` is a singleton (per process) that owns the records.

Design constraints:

- **Single process.** Records live in memory. A multi-replica deployment
  would need sticky sessions or a shared store; that's out of scope for
  Phase 1 (issue text calls this out explicitly).
- **Closing the SSE connection does not kill the run.** Each record's
  asyncio Task runs independently of any subscriber. The registry holds
  a strong reference so the task isn't GC'd. The SSE response is a thin
  subscriber that reads events from a per-record subscriber queue.
- **Replay-then-live.** A new subscriber sees every event already in
  ``record.trace.events`` (replay), then transitions to live consumption
  via its own queue. Multiple subscribers per record are supported —
  each gets its own queue, attached to the trace via ``Trace.attach_queue``
  semantics. (Today Trace only supports one queue; this module wraps that
  by fanning out at append-time. See ``_FanoutTrace`` below.)
- **Eviction.** On completion, the record stays in memory for
  ``EVICTION_TTL_SECONDS`` (default 3600). After that, it's evicted —
  callers asking for it get 404. Persistence to CouchDB is a follow-up.
- **Auth scoping.** Records track ``user_id``. Lookup-by-id callers must
  check ownership before exposing the record. (After ISSUE-002 lands,
  widen to workspace membership.)
